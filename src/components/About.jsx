          <p>
            I am a Security Analyst with hands-on experience in VAPT, network security, and OSINT reconnaissance. 
            At SYSAP Technologies in Pune, I performed network and web application security testing using tools 
            like Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux. I also contributed to incident response, analysis, 
            and vulnerability documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a strong foundation in networking, including routing, switching, VLANs, VPNs, and core protocols 
            such as TCP/IP, DNS, and DHCP. I also actively work on security projects such as OSINT automation 
            platforms and networking lab environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I follow an AI-assisted ("vibe coding") approach to accelerate development, troubleshooting, documentation, 
            and workflow building—leveraging modern AI tools to enhance productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about cybersecurity, continuous learning, and hands-on labs, aiming for roles in 
            Security Analysis, Network Security, and Cybersecurity Engineering.
