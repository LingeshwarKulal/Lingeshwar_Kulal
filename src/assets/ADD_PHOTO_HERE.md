# IMPORTANT: Add Your Profile Photo

Please save your profile photo as `profile.jpg` in this directory (`src/assets/`).

The photo from your portfolio should be:
1. Named exactly: `profile.jpg`
2. Saved in: `E:\Portfolio\portfolio-website\src\assets\`
3. Format: JPG or JPEG
4. Recommended size: 400x400px (square)

Once you add the photo, the Hero section will display it with a nice cybersecurity-themed border and glow effect.

## Quick Steps:

1. Right-click the profile photo you want to use
2. Save/Copy it to this folder (`E:\Portfolio\portfolio-website\src\assets\`)
3. Rename it to `profile.jpg` if it has a different name
4. Run `npm run dev` to see it in action!
